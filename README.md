Sample for Nested Vector Interrupt Controller programming in ARM Cortex-M4F processor Tiva C launchpad (TM4C123GXL). The main objective of this code is to blink on different board leds for every onboard switch press by programming Interrupt on GPIO Port and  NVIC peripheral present in Tiva C launchpad (TM4C123GXL). 
Detailed explanation of the implementation is as follows.
For Switch 1 pressed- Green LED is blinked thrice.
For Switch 0 pressed - blue LED is blinked thrice.
When no switch is pressed - Red LED is blinked continuously.
